
Figure7.m is the Matlab script that creates Figure7.pdf


This annotated script is designed to calculate the predictive mean and standard error for the PPLE PCA, PPLE gKDR and PPCE for varying case of the Terzaghi consolidation problem.

The function file predict_intgasp.m calculates the PPLE mean and variance at an untested input.


This script employs two available Matlab packages: ppgasp() and gkDR()

The folder "functions" contains the RobustGaSP-in-Matlab package which can be found here:

The functions gKDR.m and associated function files can be found here https://www.ism.ac.jp/~fukumizu/software.html
